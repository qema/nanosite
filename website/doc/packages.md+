# packages
Calling `nanosite import [name]` will import a package.
If `[name]` isn't already in the `.nanosite` file's `installed-packages` array:

1. Search for package file
	1. Check `[name].zip` in top-level of site directory
	2. Check `[package-url]/[name].zip` where `[package-url]` is the value of the "package-url" entry in the site's `.nanosite` file. Download this to site root.
2. Install package
 	1. Open `rules.json` in `[name].zip`. It should be a dictionary `{}`. Call it `rules`.
	2. Install dependencies: go through the import routine for each list item (dependency name) in `rules["dependencies"]`.
	3. For each key (filename) in `rules["files"]`, call its corresponding value `rule`. Get the destination path `dest` by compiling `rule["dest"]` against the default context (specifically with `OutputDir` and `MetaDir` entries). `dest` should be relative to the site top directory. Open `dest` with file mode `rule["action"]` (`"a"` for append, `"w"` for write) and write the contents of the file from `[name].zip`.
3. Finalize
    1. Add `[name]` to the array in the `.nanosite` file's `installed-packages` entry
    2. Delete `[name].zip` if downloaded from `[package-url]`
