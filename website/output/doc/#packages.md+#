# packages
Calling "nanosite import [name]" will import a package.
If [name] isn't already in the ".nanosite" file's "installed-packages" array:

1. Search for package file
	 1. Check [name].zip in top-level of site directory
	 2. Check [package-url]/[name].zip where [package-url] is the value of the "package-url" entry in the site's ".nanosite" file. Download this to site root.
2. Install package
 	 1. Open "rules.json" in [name].zip. It should be a dictionary { }. Call it rules.
	 2. Install dependencies: go through the import routine for each list item (dependency name) in rules["dependencies"].
	 3. For each key (filename) in rules["files"], call its corresponding value rule. Get the destination path dest by compiling rule["dest"] against the default context (specifically with "OutputDir" and "MetaDir" entries). dest should be relative to the site top directory. Open dest with file mode rule["action"] ("a" for append, "w" for write) and write the contents of the file from [name].zip.
3. Finalize
        1. Add [name] to the array in the ".nanosite" file's "installed-packages" entry
        2. Delete [name].zip if downloaded from [package-url]


# rules.json

	{
	  "files": {
		"[filename1.ext]": {"dest": [destination-path], "action": "[a or w]"},
		...
	  },
	  "dependencies": [
		"[dependency-name-1]", ...
	  ]
	}
