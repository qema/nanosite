<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a visualization of social networks in three Shakespeare plays, created with Python and <a href="http://visjs.org">vis.js</a>, using data from the <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu">MIT Shakespare collection</a>.</p>
<p>Each vertex represents a character, and the edges connect characters who talk with each other. I did this by taking all the sets of characters on stage between each stage direction, and then merging these sets. This turns out to be a good heuristic because it breaks groups between character entrances and exits, and other stage directions simply cause redundant groups to form which get filtered during merging.</p>
<p>The edges are modeled as physical springs with vis.js so clusters tend to form based on the emergent "cliques". Finally, the characters are colored in the graph by popularity.</p></article>
