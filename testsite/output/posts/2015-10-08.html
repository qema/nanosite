----(Title: Hello World!<br>

The content of this post is: [Begin]<p>Hi. I'm Andrew. I'm in CS at Cornell. I think in computer science and philosophy. I pass the Turing test most of the time. I'm excited to share with you my adventures in artificial intelligence, games and computer music.</p>
<p>So I'm starting this new blog format. To start off, on Mondays and Fridays, I'll spotlight one of my previous projects. Here's a preview:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Land of Stuff: online role-playing game.</li>
<li>Sound Transfer: transfer data between computers with microphone and speaker.</li>
<li>Author: a text classifier that figures out who wrote an essay or book.</li>
</ul>
<p>This site is made using my own static site generator, <a href="https://github.com/losmmorpg/nanosite">nanosite</a>. The vision is for making website content to be as intuitive and beautiful as possible, through simple tools and workflow. Right now it is a baby.</p>
<p>Also, here's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort">QuickSort</a> in <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a>!</p>
<pre><code>let rec sort = function
| [] -&gt; []
| h::t -&gt; let pivot = h in
          let (left, right) = List.partition ((&gt;) pivot) t in
          (sort left) @ [pivot] @ (sort right)
</code></pre>
<p>Stay tuned for more.</p>[End])----
